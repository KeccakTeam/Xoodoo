Notation:
Na, Nm, Nc : the number of complete blocks of associated data, plaintext, and ciphertext, respectively
Ina, Inm, Inc : binary variables equal to 1 if the last block of the respective data type is incomplete, and 0 otherwise
Bla, Blm, Blc : the number of bytes in the incomplete block of associated data, plaintext, and ciphertext, respectively.


Variants:

v1: xoodyak_1r

a. Design goal:
Support for authenticated encryption and decryption (no hashing).
Basic iterative, providing trade-off between throughput and area.
No BRAMs, no DSP units.

b. Supported maximum sizes of inputs: 
2^{50}-1

c. Reference software implementation: 
/xoodyak/Implementations/crypto_aead/xoodyakv1/ref
in the submission package to NIST 
https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/lightweight-cryptography/round-2-candidates

d. Non-default values of generics and constants
None

e. Block sizes
AD block size = 352 bits
Plaintext/Ciphertext block size = 192 bits

f. Execution times
Execution time of authenticated encryption:
27+(11*Na+Ina*ceil(Bla/4)+15*(Na+1))+(6*Nm+Inm*ceil(Blm/4)+15*(Nm+1))+18

Execution time of authenticated decryption:
27+(11*Na+Ina*ceil(Bla/4)+15*(Na+1))+(6*Nc+Inm*ceil(Blc/4)+15*(Nc+1))+19

g. Latencies
Latency of authenticated encryption:
14

Latency of authenticated decryption:
14

h. Difference between execution times for a new key and the same key
0
