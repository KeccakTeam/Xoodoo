This folder contains the hardware implementation of the algorithms submitted to the NIST LWC competition.
The implementation is compliant with the Hardware API for Lightweight Cryptography.

The folder is structured in the following way:
- ASIC/AEAD/ contains the ASIC implementation of the algorithm submitted for authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
- ASIC/AEADandHashing/ contains the ASIC implementation of the algorithm submitted for authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) and the algorithm submitted for hashing
- FPGA/AEAD/ contains the FPGA implementation of the algorithm submitted for authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
- FPGA/AEADandHashing/ contains the FPGA implementation of the algorithm submitted for authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) and the algorithm submitted for hashing

Each of the above folders contains two subfolders:
- Xoodyak_R2 contains the implementation of the algorithm submitted to Round 2 of the NIST LWC competition
- Xoodyak_R3 contains the implementation of the algorithm submitted to Round 3 of the NIST LWC competition
