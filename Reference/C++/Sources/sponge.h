  * Class implementing the sponge construction.
  * This class uses a given transformation (inherited from class
  * Transformation or Permutation).
  * The following restrictions are made:
  * - the input message can have any length (not necessarily a multiple
  *     of 8), but all calls to absorb() <em>except the last one</em>
  *     must give a multiple of 8 bits;
  * - if the rate is a multiple of 8, the output stream can be given per byte only;
  * - if the rate is not a multiple of 8, the output stream can be given per whole blocks only.
